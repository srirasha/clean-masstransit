# clean-masstransit

A tentative of MassTransit implementation over RabbitMQ on clean architecture.

The solution includes 2 apis. A producer and a consumer.

Run:

`docker-compose up -d`

And you are good.

It will launch an instance of RabbitMQ, one producer-api and one consumer-api.

All connected.
